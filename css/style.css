/*Skip to Main Each page has a "Skip to Main Content"
Links to an external site.
 link that only appears when it has focus (using the tab key) and works
When selected it should jump me to the main tag. 
    Should be hidden upon page load
    When it has focus it becomes visible
    When selected it jumps me to the main tag
    You can use the same styling and format you used for HW#3
Navigation-  All four pages are linked via a common navigation structure that works well for a mobile device
    Order of navigation elements should stay the same on all of your pages  
    You use CSS to indicate the current page (Active page) within the links in the navigation
    Your menu should work for a smaller mobile view 
    I can easily click on all links and buttons when viewing this site on my mobile device. 
    Each page should have a unique name (H1) which should match with your title to some degree
Footer: You should have a consistent footer across your site - this means your footer should be the same across all of your pages and the information should be the same across all of your pages. 


Your design is visually appealing and modern looking
Your design fits within and utilizes the UM Branding Guidelines
 
all content should be available on mobile devices & smartphones
    
        The font is big enough for me to click on each link from a mobile device (we recommend checking on your device)
        Use of fluid measurements (%, rem, em, fr, vw, etc.) where possible and where it makes sense for your design
        We are expecting you to heavily use Grid for this assignment - how you choose to deploy it is up to you. 
        You should use Grid on at least 2 pages (though you can use it for all 4!)
        Using just a 1 column Grid isn't an example of good responsive web design (RWD)
        You can use Flex (but are not required to )
