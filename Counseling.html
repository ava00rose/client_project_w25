            <h2 tabindex=0>Mental Health Support Options</h2>
            <p tabindex=0> At the University of Michigan, we recognizes there is no “one size fits all” approach to supporting student mental health. That's why we have CAPS to provide a variety of options to meet a diversity of needs. Check out the options listed below to see what may be a good fit for you.
            <br>
            Most of you know that individual counseling is one option -- but we know that not everyone wants or needs individual therapy with a professional -- so we've created other options which are noted below with a brief description to help you decide what route you may want to take. </p>
