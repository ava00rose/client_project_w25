Brand look and feel: ensure that your 404 page reflects your site’s overall design. Keep the same logo, colors, and style so it feels like part of the website and not a mistake.

A light touch: adding a bit of humor or a lighthearted message can make the experience less frustrating for the user. Just be careful not to overdo it.

Link to your best content: provide 3 or 4 links to popular or interesting parts of your site. This can help redirect lost visitors and keep them engaged instead of leaving your website.

Call to action: since your 404 page functions like a landing page, include a CTA (call to action). This could be a signup button, download link, or at the very least, a search box so users can easily find what they’re looking for.
